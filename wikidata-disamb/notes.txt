# Entities

Total number of entities: 80371
Considering both the "correct_id" and "wrong_id" found in the train, test and dev files.
However, 258 of them appear to not correspond to any entity in wikidata, maybe due to the entities being moved to a new identifier (without keeping any trace of the old one though, which is weird since I believe the common practice in wikidata for those cases is to use the property `owl:sameAs` to link the old id to the new one). Out of these 258 entities, 250 of them belong to the "wrong_id" annotations and 8 of them to the "correct_id" instead.

Unfortunately, for the 250 entities from the "wrong_id" annotations we cannot recover any information and most likely we will need to discard them. Whereas, for the 8 entities that belong to the "correct_id" set, we can at least resort to the annotations found in the dataset:

After redirection, the total 80371 entities reduced to 79788. This is due to some of the original entities being merged in wikidata to a single entity at some point. Indeed, 1558 of the original entities had a redirection to a new entity, but 583 of them were redirected to an already existing entity in the dataset. Thus, 80371 - 583 = 79788.

Overall, after redirecting and manually annotating all the possible missing entities we ended up with 79539 entities. However, out of these entities, 901 of them did not have any description available, and 9890 of them had an apparently meaningless description such as `Wikimedia disambiguation page`.
