At room temperature, it is a colourless non-flammable gas, and has a slightly sweet scent and taste.[5] At elevated temperatures, nitrous oxide is a powerful oxidiser similar to molecular oxygen.\nNitrous oxide has significant medical uses, especially in surgery and dentistry, for its anaesthetic and pain-reducing effects.[6] Its colloquial name, \"laughing gas\", coined by Humphry Davy, is due to the euphoric effects upon inhaling it, a property that has led to its recreational use as a dissociative anaesthetic.[6] It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines.[7] It is also used as an oxidiser in rocket propellants, and in motor racing to increase the power output of engines.\nNitrous oxide's atmospheric concentration reached 333\u00a0parts per billion (ppb) in 2020, increasing at a rate of about 1\u00a0ppb annually.[8][9]  It is a major scavenger of stratospheric ozone, with an impact comparable to that of CFCs.[10]  About 40% of human-caused emissions are from agriculture.[11][12]  Nitrogen is added to the soil via animal urine and dung, and synthetic fertilisers: micro-organisms then release it in nitrous oxide.[13] Being the third most important greenhouse gas, nitrous oxide substantially contributes to global warming.[14][15] Reduction of emissions is a popular topic in the politics of climate change.[16]\nNitrous oxide is used as a propellant, and has a variety of applications from rocketry to making whipped cream. It is used as a recreational drug for its potential to induce a brief \"high\". When used chronically, nitrous oxide has the potential to cause neurological damage through inactivation of vitamin B12.\n",

She was the first of only two American cargo sloops ever built with a wrought iron hull. After ten years of service in the Delaware Bay, she was re-rigged as a schooner for easier handling.\nIn 1930, the Pioneer was sold to a buyer in Massachusetts. By this point, she had been fitted with an engine and no longer being used as a sailing vessel.

His reign saw a consolidation of Byzantine security from external threats. As an able military leader, Constantine took advantage of civil war in the Muslim world to make limited offensives on the Arab frontier. With this eastern frontier secure, he undertook repeated campaigns against the Bulgars in the Balkans. His military activity, and policy of settling Christian populations from the Arab frontier in Thrace, made Byzantium's hold on its Balkan territories more secure. He was also responsible for important military and administrative innovations and reforms.\nReligious strife and controversy was a prominent feature of his reign. His fervent support of Iconoclasm and opposition to monasticism led to his vilification by some contemporary commentators and the majority of later Byzantine writers, who denigrated him with the nicknames \"Dung-Named\" (Greek: \u039a\u03bf\u03c0\u03c1\u03ce\u03bd\u03c5\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2, translit.\u00a0Kopr\u00f3nimos; Latin: Copronymus), because he allegedly defaecated during his baptism,[3][1] similarly \"Anointed with Urine\" (Greek: \u039f\u1f50\u03c1\u03b1\u03bb\u03cd\u03c6\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2, translit.\u00a0Oural\u00fdphios; Latin: Uralyphius),[4] and \"the Equestrian\" (Greek: \u039a\u03b1\u03b2\u03b1\u03bb\u03bb\u03b9\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2, translit.\u00a0Kaballinos; Latin: Caballinus), referencing the excrement of horses.[3][5]\nConstantine was born in Constantinople, the son and successor of Emperor Leo III and his wife Maria. In the Easter of 720, at two years of age, he was associated with his father on the throne, and crowned co-emperor by Patriarch Germanus I.[1] In Byzantine political theory more than one emperor could share the throne; however, although all were accorded the same ceremonial status, only one emperor wielded ultimate power. As the position of emperor was in theory, and sometimes in practise, elective rather than strictly hereditary, a ruling emperor would often associate a son or other chosen successor with himself as a co-emperor to ensure the eventual succession.[6] To celebrate the coronation of his son, Leo III introduced a new silver coin, the miliaresion; worth a 12th of a gold nomisma, it soon became an integral part of the Byzantine economy. In 726, Constantine's father issued the Ecloga; a revised legal code, it was attributed to both father and son jointly. Constantine married Tzitzak, daughter of the Khazar khagan Bihar, an important Byzantine ally. His new bride was baptized Irene (Eir\u0113n\u0113, \"peace\") in 732. On his father's death, Constantine succeeded as sole emperor on 18 June 741.[7][8][9][10]\nHistorical accounts of Constantine make reference to a chronic medical condition, possibly epilepsy or leprosy; early in his reign this may have been employed by those rebelling against him to question his fitness to be emperor.[11]\n",

  "Q40614": "\nA fossil (from Classical Latin fossilis, lit.\u2009'obtained by digging')[1] is any preserved remains, impression, or trace of any once-living thing from a past geological age. Examples include bones, shells, exoskeletons, stone imprints of animals or microbes, objects preserved in amber, hair, petrified wood and DNA remnants. The totality of fossils is known as the fossil record.\nPaleontology includes the study of fossils: their age, method of formation, and evolutionary significance. Specimens are usually considered to be fossils if they are over 10,000 years old.[2] The oldest fossils are around 3.48\u00a0billion years [3][4][5] to 4.1\u00a0billion years old.[6][7] The observation in the 19th century that certain fossils were associated with certain rock strata led to the recognition of a geological timescale and the relative ages of different fossils. The development of radiometric dating techniques in the early 20th century allowed scientists to quantitatively measure the absolute ages of rocks and the fossils they host.\nThere are many processes that lead to fossilization, including permineralization, casts and molds, authigenic mineralization, replacement and recrystallization, adpression, carbonization, and bioimmuration.\nFossils vary in size from one-micrometre (1\u00a0\u03bcm) bacteria[8] to dinosaurs and trees, many meters long and weighing many tons. A fossil normally preserves only a portion of the deceased organism, usually that portion that was partially mineralized during life, such as the bones and teeth of vertebrates, or the chitinous or calcareous exoskeletons of invertebrates. Fossils may also consist of the marks left behind by the organism while it was alive, such as animal tracks or feces (coprolites). These types of fossil are called trace fossils or ichnofossils, as opposed to body fossils. Some fossils are biochemical and are called chemofossils or biosignatures.\n",
  "Q35856": "\nBaptism (from Koin\u0113 Greek: \u03b2\u03ac\u03c0\u03c4\u03b9\u03c3\u03bc\u03b1, romanized:\u00a0v\u00e1ptisma, lit.\u2009'immersion, dipping in water')[1] is a Christian sacrament of initiation almost invariably with the use of water.[2][3] It may be performed by sprinkling or pouring water on the head, or by immersing in water either partially or completely, traditionally three times, once for each person of the Trinity.[4][5][6] The synoptic gospels recount that John the Baptist baptised Jesus.[7][8][9][10] Baptism is considered a sacrament in most churches, and as an ordinance in others. Baptism according to the Trinitarian formula, which is done in most mainstream Christian denominations, is seen as being a basis for Christian ecumenism, the concept of unity amongst Christians.[11][12][13] Baptism is also called christening,[14][15] although some reserve the word \"christening\" for the baptism of infants.[16] In certain Christian denominations, such as the Catholic Churches, Eastern Orthodox Churches, Oriental Orthodox Churches, Assyrian Church of the East, and Lutheran Churches, baptism is the door to church membership, with candidates taking baptismal vows.[17][18] It has also given its name to the Baptist churches and denominations.\nCertain schools of Christian thought (such as Catholic and Lutheran theology) regard baptism as necessary for salvation, but some writers, such as Huldrych Zwingli (1484\u20131531), have denied its necessity.[19] Though water baptism is extremely common among Christian denominations, some, such as Quakers and The Salvation Army, do not practice water baptism at all.[20] Among denominations that practice baptism, differences occur in the manner and mode of baptizing and in the understanding of the significance of the rite. Most Christians baptize using the trinitarian formula \"in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit\"[21] (following the Great Commission), but Oneness Pentecostals baptize using Jesus' name only.[22] The majority of Christians baptize infants;[a] many others, such as Baptist Churches, regard only believer's baptism as true baptism.[23] In certain denominations, such as the Eastern and Oriental Orthodox Churches, the individual being baptized receives a cross necklace that is worn for the rest of their life, inspired by the Sixth Ecumenical Council (Synod) of Constantinople.[24][25]\nOutside of Christianity, Mandaeans undergo repeated baptism for purification instead of initiation.[26] They consider John the Baptist to be their greatest prophet and name all rivers yardena after the River Jordan.[26][27][28]:\u200a45\u200a\nThe term baptism has also been used metaphorically to refer to any ceremony, trial, or experience by which a person is initiated, purified, or given a name.[29] Martyrdom was identified early in Christian church history as \"baptism by blood\", enabling the salvation of martyrs who had not been baptized by water. Later, the Catholic Church identified a baptism of desire, by which those preparing for baptism who die before actually receiving the sacrament are considered saved.[30] In the Methodist tradition, Baptism with the Holy Spirit, has referred to the second work of grace, entire sanctification; in Pentecostalism, the term Baptism with the Holy Spirit is identified with speaking in tongues.[31]\n",

He wrote \"These Days\" as a 16-year-old; the song became a minor hit for the German singer and Andy Warhol prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Nico in 1967. He also wrote several songs for fellow Southern California bands the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band (of which he was briefly a member in 1966) and Eagles, the latter of whom had their first Billboard Top 40 hit in 1972 with the Browne co-written song \"Take It Easy\".\nEncouraged by his successes writing songs for others, Browne released his self-titled debut album in 1972, which spawned two Top 40 hits of his own, \"Doctor, My Eyes\" and \"Rock Me on the Water\". For his debut album, as well as the next several albums and concert tours, Browne started to work closely with The Section, a prolific session band which also worked with a number of other prominent singer-songwriters of the era. His second album, For Everyman, was released in 1973. While it lacked an enduring single, it has been retrospectively assessed as some of his best work, appearing highly on several \"Best Album of All Time\" lists. His third album, Late for the Sky (1974), was his most successful to that point, peaking at number 14 on the Billboard 200 album chart. His fourth album, The Pretender (1976), continued the pattern of each album topping the previous by peaking at number 5 on the album chart, and spawned the hit singles \"Here Come Those Tears Again\" and \"The Pretender\".\nBrowne's 1977 album Running on Empty, however, is his signature work; it rose to number 3 on the album chart and remained there for over a year. Both live and a concept album, it explores in its songs the themes of life as a touring musician, and the album was recorded both on stage and in places touring musicians spend time when not playing, such as hotel rooms, backstage, and in one case on a moving tour bus. The album produced two Top 40 singles, \"Running on Empty\" and \"The Load-Out/Stay\", and many of the other tracks became popular radio hits on the AOR format.\n",

  "Q2829382": "Al McCoy,[1] (October 23, 1894 \u2013 August 22, 1966), born Alexander Rudolph, was a boxing World Middleweight Champion from 1914 to 1917.[2] He had a total of 157 bouts. Of those determined officially, he won 44 with 27 by knockout, and had 6 losses, and 6 draws. Around 107 of his fights were no decision bouts.[citation needed]\nReferees and judges in this era could not render a decision for fights in New York and most other states except in the case of a disqualification or knockout.  McCoy's BoxRec record on the right has newspaper coverage determining the winner for his large number of no decision bouts. Newspapers could also determine the outcome of a fight as a draw.[3]\nMcCoy was born Alexander Rudolph in Rosenhayn, Deerfield Township, New Jersey, on October 23, 1894. As a child, he moved with his family to Brownsville, Brooklyn, New York City, where his father found work as a kosher butcher. At age 14 he helped make ends meet by filling in as a boxer for preliminary fights at local boxing clubs, when the scheduled boxers failed to show.\nKen Blady speculates that his manager, Charley Goldman, had him change his surname to McCoy to hide his boxing from his religious parents who would have objected. Blady made the stunning observation that for his first nine years and 139 fights McCoy was undefeated.  This made his winning streak second only to English boxer Hal Bagwell, although the fact that a no-decision bout did not officially count as a loss, probably aided McCoy's record.[4]\nMcCoy started boxing as a bantamweight, but fighting as a 138-pound lightweight in 1912, he began to attract attention. He defeated Young Erne, a competent Philadelphia lightweight, on November 9, 1912, in Philadelphia, winning in six rounds. The newspaper that gave him the edge noted that Erne was too out of condition to match well with the fit sixteen year old.[4]\n",
  "Q732845": "\nMariah Carey is the debut studio album by American R&B singer Mariah Carey, released on June 12, 1990, by Columbia Records. Its music incorporates a range of contemporary genres with a mix of slow ballads and up-tempo tracks. Originally, Carey wrote four songs with Ben Margulies, which solely constituted her demo tape. After Carey was signed to Columbia, all four songs, after being altered and partially re-recorded, made the final cut for the album. Aside from Margulies, Carey worked with a range of professional writers and producers, all of whom were hired by Columbia CEO, Tommy Mottola. Mariah Carey featured production and writing from Rhett Lawrence, Ric Wake and Narada Michael Walden, all of whom were top record producers at the time. Together with Carey, they conceived the album and reconstructed her original demo tape.\nMariah Carey generally received positive reviews, with critics praising Carey's vocal performance and technique, but were ambivalent towards the songwriting. It became a commercial success, topping the U.S. Billboard 200 album chart for 11 consecutive weeks. Mariah Carey was certified nine-times Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), denoting shipments of nine\u00a0million copies in the United States. The album experienced similar success in Canada, where it topped the charts and was certified seven times Platinum. Mariah Carey fared well in other worldwide territories, reaching the top ten in Australia, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Sweden and the United Kingdom. Worldwide, the album has sold more than 15 million copies.\nFive singles were released from the album, four of which became number-one hits on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100. Her debut single, \"Vision of Love\" was chosen as the album's lead single, topping the charts in Canada, New Zealand and the United States. The song was critically lauded, and is regarded as one of the strongest debut singles by a female artist. With the following three singles, \"Love Takes Time\", \"Someday\" and \"I Don't Wanna Cry\" reaching number one in the U.S., Carey became the first artist since The Jackson 5 to have their first four singles top the charts in the United States.\nIn 1988, a 19-year-old Carey moved out of her mother's house in Long Island, and into a small apartment in Manhattan.[3] She had a demo tape consisting of four songs, which she had written during her high school years with Ben Margulies.[3] As 1988 unfolded, Carey, still without a record deal, struggled to draw the attention of record executives in New York. While working several jobs, she continued writing and producing music with Margulies, making changes and additions to the demo.[4] After months of difficulty, Carey met with singer Brenda K. Starr, and soon began singing back-up for her.[4] Eventually, Starr began hearing what she described as \"glimpses\" of Carey's voice throughout sessions, and noticed her \"gifted voice\".[5] She realized Carey was capable of achieving success, but only needed help to break through into mainstream music.[5]\n",
  "Q515931": "\n\nWillow is a 1988 American epic dark fantasy adventure film directed by Ron Howard and produced by Nigel Wooll. The film was executive produced by George Lucas and written by Bob Dolman from a story by Lucas. The film stars Val Kilmer, Joanne Whalley, Warwick Davis, and Jean Marsh. Davis portrays the title character, an aspiring magician who teams up with a disaffected warrior (Kilmer) to protect a young baby princess from an evil queen (Marsh).\nLucas conceived the idea for the film in 1972, approaching Howard to direct during the post-production phase of Cocoon in 1985. Bob Dolman was brought in to write the screenplay, coming up with seven drafts that Lucas was actively involved in the developmental process of each draft.[4] It was finished in late 1986. It was then set up at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) and principal photography began in April 1987, finishing the following October. The majority of filming took place in Dinorwic quarry in Wales with some at Elstree Studios in Hertfordshire, as well as a small section in New Zealand. Industrial Light & Magic created the visual effects sequences, which led to a revolutionary breakthrough with digital morphing technology.\nThe film was released in 1988 to mixed reviews from critics with praise for the visual effects and character designs but criticisms for its direction and plot. It grossed $137.6 million worldwide against a $35 million budget. While not the blockbuster some expected, it turned a profit based on international box office returns and strong home video and television returns. It received two Academy Award nominations. A television series that served as a sequel to the film was released on Disney+ in 2022.\n",

In late 2002, Yoshiki, the drummer and pianist \u043ef X Japan, joined the group, but he left the band about a year later.\nThe first album, Globe (1996), sold over 4 million copies and their 1998 single ,\"wanna Be A Dreammaker\", won the grand prix award at the 40th Japan Record Awards, the Japanese record industry's highest honor. Komuro said that there would be some collaboration work with other artists with the artist title of Globe Featuring, and Globe Extreme for collaborations with Yoshiki.\nIn the climb of his fame, producer Komuro organized one of his castings, searching for new singers in 1994 (especially one that was called Eurogroove Night). The young girl Keiko Yamada assisted, encouraged by her friends, and her voice undoubtedly attracted Komuro's attention instantly. He chose her initially for a solo career. Another one of the careers that TK was thinking about producing at that time was that of the model and MTV VJ Marc Panther, who knew English and French as well as from Japanese. Komuro finally had the idea to make a band using Yamada and Panther as main vocalists and himself as keyboard player and also some vocals.\nThe band signed with the Avex label in 1995, creating its own sub-label called \"Avex Globe\". In August 1995, the first single, \"Feel Like Dance\", was released.The fourth single, \"Departures\", released in 1996, sold more than 2 million copies.

The \"Grand Union\" name survived until the canal was bought by the Grand Junction in 1894 and became known as the Leicester Line of the Grand Junction. The larger Grand Junction Canal was subsequently bought by the Regent's Canal and from 1 January 1929 the whole network was known as the Grand Union Canal. Where clarity between the two Grand Unions is needed, the original Grand Union Canal is generally referred to as the Old Grand Union.\nIn 1793, an Act was passed for the Leicestershire and Northamptonshire Union Canal: this was intended to link the Soar Navigation near Leicester to the River Nene near Northampton, and thus to the Grand Junction Canal via the latter's Northampton Arm.[3] The Leicestershire and Northampton union reached the village of Debdale by 1797, but in doing so had used up all of its money. James Barnes, an engineer working on the Grand Junction Canal, was asked in 1799 to find a route for the canal to reach the Grand Junction at Braunston. In 1802, he produced a revised proposal, to route the rest of the canal to Norton on the Grand Junction, with a branch to Market Harborough. Thomas Telford was then asked for his opinion, and he also proposed a change of destination to Norton, but via the town of Market Harborough. This was agreed upon, but by 1809, the canal had reached only Market Harborough, where construction came to an end again.[4]\nThe Grand Junction Canal Company were concerned about these delays to the opening of the important route to the east Midlands, which would bring traffic onto their canal from the River Trent and the Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire coalfields.

There are several types of skeletons, including the exoskeleton, which is a rigid outer shell that holds up an organism's shape; the endoskeleton, a rigid internal frame to which the organs and soft tissues attach; and the hydroskeleton, a flexible internal structure supported by the hydrostatic pressure of body fluids.\nVertebrates are animals with an endoskeleton centered around an axial vertebral column, and their skeletons are typically composed of bones and cartilages. Invertebrates are other animals that lack a vertebral column, and their skeletons vary, including hard-shelled exoskeleton (arthropods and most molluscs), plated internal shells (e.g. cuttlebones in some cephalopods) or rods (e.g. ossicles in echinoderms), hydrostatically supported body cavities (most), and spicules (sponges). Cartilage is a rigid connective tissue that is found in the skeletal systems of vertebrates and invertebrates.\nThe term skeleton comes from Ancient Greek  \u03c3\u03ba\u03b5\u03bb\u03b5\u03c4\u03cc\u03c2 (skelet\u00f3s)\u00a0'dried up'.[1] Sceleton is an archaic form of the word.[2]\nSkeletons can be defined by several attributes. Solid skeletons consist of hard substances, such as bone, cartilage, or cuticle. These can be further divided by location; internal skeletons are endoskeletons, and external skeletons are exoskeletons. Skeletons may also be defined by rigidity, where pliant skeletons are more elastic than rigid skeletons.[3] Fluid or hydrostatic skeletons do not have hard structures like solid skeletons, instead functioning via pressurized fluids. Hydrostatic skeletons are always internal.[4]\n",

  "Q17736": "\nAn axiom, postulate, or assumption is a statement that is taken to be true, to serve as a premise or starting point for further reasoning and arguments. The word comes from the Ancient Greek word \u1f00\u03be\u03af\u03c9\u03bc\u03b1 (ax\u00ed\u014dma), meaning 'that which is thought worthy or fit' or 'that which commends itself as evident'.[1][2]\nThe precise definition varies across fields of study. In classic philosophy, an axiom is a statement that is so evident or well-established, that it is accepted without controversy or question.[3] In modern logic, an axiom is a premise or starting point for reasoning.[4]\nIn mathematics, an axiom may be a \"logical axiom\" or a \"non-logical axiom\". Logical axioms are taken to be true within the system of logic they define and are often shown in symbolic form (e.g., (A and B) implies A), while non-logical axioms are substantive assertions about the elements of the domain of a specific mathematical theory, for example a\u00a0+\u00a00\u00a0=\u00a0a in integer arithmetic.\nNon-logical axioms may also be called \"postulates\", \"assumptions\" or \"proper axioms\".[5] In most cases, a non-logical axiom is simply a formal logical expression used in deduction to build a mathematical theory, and might or might not be self-evident in nature (e.g., the parallel postulate in Euclidean geometry). To axiomatize a system of knowledge is to show that its claims can be derived from a small, well-understood set of sentences (the axioms), and there are typically many ways to axiomatize a given mathematical domain.\n",
  "Q841325": "The Qiang people (Qiangic: Rrmea; Chinese: \u7f8c\u65cf; pinyin: Qi\u0101ngz\u00fa) are an ethnic group in China. They form one of the 56 ethnic groups officially recognised by the People's Republic of China, with a population of approximately 310,000 in 2000.[1] They live mainly in a mountainous region in the northwestern part of Sichuan (Szechwan) on the eastern edge of the Tibetan Plateau.[2]\nThe modern Qiang refer to themselves as Rma (/\u0279m\u00e6\u02d0/ or /\u0279m\u025b\u02d0/, \u5c14\u739b, erma in Chinese or RRmea in Qiang orthography) or a dialect variant of this word. However, they did not define themselves with the Chinese term \"Qiang ethnicity\" (Chinese: \u7f8c\u65cf) until 1950, when they were officially designated Qi\u0101ngz\u00fa.[3]\nQiang has been a term that has historically referred less to a specific community, but more to the fluid western boundary of Han Chinese settlers. Chinese philosophers of the Warring States period also mentioned a 'Di-Qiang' peoples living on the western edge of Han territory. They were known for their customs of cremation.[4]\nPeople called \"Qiang\" have been mentioned in ancient Chinese texts since 3,000 years ago when they first appeared in oracle bone inscriptions. Recognized as a 'first ancestor culture', there is evidence of the Qiang in northwestern China dating back to the 16th-11th centuries B.C., when they were recorded bringing tribute to the Shang Dynasty.[5][6] They were primarily known to practice pastoral nomadism, and resisted westward expansion of the Han Empire, gradually shifting to the south-west of their ancestral lands.\nHowever, the name Qiang has been applied to a variety of groups that might not be the same as the modern Qiang. Many of the people formerly designated as \"Qiang\" were gradually removed from this category in Chinese texts as they become sinicised or reclassified.  By the Ming and Qing dynasties, the term \"Qiang\" denoted only non-Han people living in the upper Min River Valley and Beichuan area, the area now occupied by the modern Qiang.[7] Nonetheless, most modern scholarship assumes modern Qiang are descended from the historical Qiang people.[8]\n",

  "Q6499736": "\nA vocabulary (also known as a lexicon) is a set of words, typically the set in a language or the set known to an individual. The word vocabulary originated from the Latin vocabulum, meaning \"a word, name\". It forms an essential component of language and communication, helping convey thoughts, ideas, emotions, and information. Vocabulary can be oral, written, or signed and can be categorized into two main types: active vocabulary (words one uses regularly) and passive vocabulary (words one recognizes but does not use often). An individual's vocabulary continually evolves through various methods, including direct instruction, independent reading, and natural language exposure, but it can also shrink due to forgetting, trauma, or disease. Furthermore, vocabulary is a significant focus of study across various disciplines, like linguistics, education, psychology, and artificial intelligence. Vocabulary is not limited to single words; it also encompasses multi-word units known as collocations, idioms, and other types of phraseology. Acquiring an adequate vocabulary is one of the largest challenges in learning a second language.\nA vocabulary is the set of words in a given language that an individual knows and uses.[1] In the context of linguistics, a vocabulary may refer more broadly to any set of words. Types of vocabularies have been further defined: a lexis is a vocabulary comprising all words used in a language or other linguistic context or in a person's lexical repertoire. An individual person's vocabulary includes an passive vocabulary of words they can recognize or understand, as well as an active vocabulary of words they regularly use in speech and writing.[2] \nIn semiotics, vocabulary refers to the complete set of symbols and signs in a sign system or a text, extending the definition beyond purely verbal communication to encompass other forms of symbolic communication.[3]\nVocabulary acquisition is a central aspect of language education, as it directly impacts reading comprehension, expressive and receptive language skills, and academic achievement.[4] Vocabulary is examined in psychology as a measure of language processing and cognitive development. It can serve as an indicator of intellectual ability or cognitive status, with vocabulary tests often forming part of intelligence and neuropsychological assessments.[5]\nWord has a variety of meanings, and our understand of ideas such as vocabulary size differ depending on the definition used. \n",
